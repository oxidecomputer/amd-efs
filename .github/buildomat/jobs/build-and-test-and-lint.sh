# achieves two things: first, SSH URLs should be transformed on fetch without
# requiring Cargo.toml rewriting, which is especially difficult in transitive
# dependencies; second, Cargo does not seem willing on its own to look in
# ~/.netrc and find the temporary token that buildomat generates for our job,
# so we must use git which uses curl.
